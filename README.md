## ✦ About Me

I am a **backend-heavy full stack developer** with 5+ years of experience building **scalable APIs, robust backend systems, and responsive frontends**.  
I specialize in **.NET Core, Node.js/NestJS, Spring Boot** on the backend, and **React, Next.js, Vue.js** on the frontend.  

Recently, I have been exploring **Elixir and Phoenix**. I am **actively building projects and open-source libraries** in Elixir, learning to leverage its concurrency and performance features to create reliable and efficient systems.

I enjoy designing **clean, maintainable systems** that are fast, secure, and easy to scale.
